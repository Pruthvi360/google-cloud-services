#Clone the Google-supplied repo for Deployment Manager examples
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/deploymentmanager-samples.git

#cd into the directory for launching a single vm
cd deploymentmanager-samples/examples/v2/single_vm/python

#edit the yaml template and set the zone parameter to your preference

#to test the template without actually deploying resources execute the below command
#make sure the output looks something like the following:
